* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

As seen in the screenshots above, the total number of Vine reviews is 162 and the total number of non-Vine reviews is 35,606. 

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

There are 63 Vine reviews that are 5 stars.  There are 19,444 that are 5 stars.

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

5 star Vine reviews account for 39% of the total reviews.  5 star regular reviews account for 55% of the total reviews.  

## Summary: 

There does not appear to be a positivity bias for the Vine program.  Vine reviewers were a small majority of total reviews (162 Vine reviewers vs. 35,606 non-Vine reviewers) and only 39% of the Vine reviewers gave 5 star reviews. Non-vine reviewers gave 5 star reviews 55% of the time. Because Vine members provided a lesser percentage of 5 star reviews, there isn't a positivity bias. 

Analyzing the verified_purchase column may be more helpful to see if whether a verified purchase affects the ratings or not.
